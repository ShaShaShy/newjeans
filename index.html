  <h2>About NewJeans</h2><br>
  <p>NewJeans (Korean: 뉴진스; RR: Nyujinseu) is a South Korean girl group formed by ADOR, a subsidiary of Hybe Corporation. The group is composed of five members: Minji, Hanni, Danielle, Haerin and Hyein. The group pre-released their debut single "Attention" on July 22, 2022, preceding their debut eponymous extended play, which was released on August 1, 2022.</p><br>

  <p>The group's name, NewJeans, has two meanings.It alludes to the idea that jeans are a timeless fashion item and the group's intention to carve a timeless image for themselves. The name is also a word play on the phrase "new genes", referring to the group ushering a new generation of pop music. Prior to debuting with NewJeans, several group members were already active in the entertainment industry. Danielle was a regular cast member of tvN's Rainbow Kindergarten, a variety show that aired in 2011. Hyein debuted as a member of the children's music group U.SSO Girl in November 2017 under the stage name U.Jeong, before departing from the group one year later. In December 2020, she re-debuted as a member of the music group and YouTube collective Play With Me Club via PocketTV, and graduated from the group on May 3, 2021.<Br> Hanni and Minji made cameo appearances in BTS's 2021 music video for "Permission to Dance". On August 1, the group's debut self-titled EP was released digitally, alongside their third single, "Cookie".[27] The group made their broadcast debut on Mnet's M Countdown on August 4, performing all three singles from their EP.[28] On the first day of its physical release, New Jeans sold 262,815 copies, breaking several records for girl group debut in South Korea.</p>
